    {Geollect}
    {Data Scientist}
    {Bristol, UK}
    {October 2020 - ONGOING}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {I build and maintain the backend software of our vessel tracking system, Geonius. This involoves using AIS data to detect the suspicious activity of vessels e.g. close proximity of two ships.}
        \item {Since starting I have built a database of all 'suspicious' events in the global fleet of registered vessels. To do this I developed a system that takes all of the AIS data that is recorded each day and analyses is to find suspicous events. While there are a number of business use cases for this data, I have applied machine learning this dataset of past events in order to predict the occurance of future events.}
        \item {I conduct data led intelligence investigations in conjunction with the geospatial intelligence team. These include searching for vessels in close proximity to illegal activities or assesing the flow of cargo into and out of ports.}
