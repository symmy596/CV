    {Geollect}
    {Lead Data Scientist / Data Scientist}
    {Bristol, UK}
    {Dec 2021 - ONGOING / Oct 2020 - Dec 2021}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {I am the data science lead at Geollect and I manage a team of 3 data scientists and 2 data engineers. I am responsible for growing this team and coming up with and implementing the companies data strategy.}
        \item {I build and maintain the data pipelines that are used in Geollects main products. This involves building solutions to take large volumes of data from data suppliers APIs, parse and repackage it, pass it to AWS kinesis streams, and load it into our postgresql database on AWS RDS (and also save zipped csvs to AWS deep storage for backup). Furthermore I also designed and built our database, API and API endpoints.}
        \item {I am the companies main data science consultant and have provided data science expertise to the UK special forces, the royal navy and the world bank. This work involved web scraping, the construction of nosql databases, using machine learning to detect anomalies from acoustic data and designing algorythms to indentify specific instances of vessel behaviour from AIS data. I led all of these projects, in one instance this involved a team of Geollect data scientists and in another I led a team of data scientists from a partner organisation. I performed all liasons with the clients, delivered updates, delivered the final products. Furthermore I was responsible for the allocated resources and calculating the cost of services.}
        \item {I apply machine learning to AIS data (vessel location broadcasts) in order to both classify different types of marine activity (e.g. fishing, anchoring etc.) as well as identifying patterns. I have researched, built and deployed gaussian mixture models and used clustering algorythms to achieve this.}
        \item {I leading an ongoing project to combine AIS data with satelite imagery data to build a database AIS enriched vessel images. As part of this project I have been applying neural networks to satelite imagery to identify vessels within an image.}
        \item {I have also engaged in more traditional data analysis. I have developed a 'digital port assessment' using AIS data, that for a given port provides statistics regarding vessel traffic into and out of that port. I employ my data visualisation skills to display this information statically in the form of graphs and tables, but also dynamically in the form of a dashboard.}
        \item {I conduct data led intelligence investigations in conjunction with the geospatial intelligence team. This involves identifying and analysing data to support the hypotheses of the investigations team.}
        \item {I am responsible for finding and assessing new data sources that could feature in our products. In a recent example of this I combined AIS data with weather data to understand cargo loss in the Pacific Ocean.}
        \item {I am responsible for producing technical articles or posts for marketing purposes.}
        \item {I take part in client meetings as the technical lead and my role is to provide technical explanations of our products as well as understand the technical requirements of client requests.}
        \item {I have represented the company at conferences where I have given talks about how Geollect is innovating in the tech space.}

    {Universtiy of Bath}
    {Postdoctoral Research Associate}
    {Bath, UK}
    {January 2020 - October 2020}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {I developed computational simulation and analysis techniques to aid in the prediction and discovery of new Li-ion battery materials.}
        \item {I Utilised machine learning models to predict the properties of theoretical battery materials. This work was in collaboration with other computational researchers at Bath university as well as researchers at the Universities of Oxford and Liverpool who were conducting the experimental side of the project.}
        \item {I am an advocate of research software engineering and open source software. During my academic career I developed and published two pieces of research software. I was also involved in the development of open source teaching material for computational chemistry and also for teaching software engineering practices to postgraduate students.}
        \item {I took part in the Faraday Institutes summer studentship scheme and secured Â£4000 of funding to hire an undergraduate student who worked on a short projected that I designed for the summer. I was responsible for writing the hiring advert, selecting candidates for interview and conducting the interviews. I then onboarded the successful candidate, taught them the programming skills required to complete the project and then oversaw the project as it progressed.}
        \item {During this time, I published four research papers, delivered presentations to both internal and external audiences and worked to and met deadlines set by my supervisors.}

    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item{Throughout the duration of my PhD I taught undergraduate chemists how to program, specifically focusing on high level programming in Python and low level programming in fortran.}
        \item{I developed a new masters level course focusing on using Python programming to better understand and make predictions about the behaviour of materials.}
        \item{Part of a project to develop a new masters course focusing on teaching students how to use Python in data analysis.}
        \item
