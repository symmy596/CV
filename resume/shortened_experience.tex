      \begin{cvitems}
        \item{Computational chemistry project - \textbf{Applications} - Nuclear Waste Remediation, Energy Materials, Enviromental Chemistry.}
		    \item{During this project I ran large scale simulations on both existing and new materials in order to generate data to use to predict their behaviour and properties.}
		    \item{In order to do this, I have developed software designed for the specific needs of the project. Full details can be found on my github (symmy596).}
