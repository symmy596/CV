\cvsection{Selected Publications}
\begin{cvparagraph}
Despite leaving academia I have maintained many research collaborations and continue to publish research. During my career I have authored 17 research papers in software development, energy materials and physics. All are available to view on my google scholar profile however I have included three below, published in the journal of open source software which I feel highlight my software engineering skills.
