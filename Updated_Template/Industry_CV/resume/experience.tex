		\begin{cvitems}
			\item {Computational chemistry project - \textbf{Applications} - Nuclear Waste Remediation, Energy Materials, Enviromental Chemistry.}
			\item {During this project I ran large scale simulations on currently used and new materials in order to generate data that I used to make
			predictions about the behaviour and properties of these materials.}
			\item{This has required the development of bespoke software designed for the specific needs of the project. Full details can be found on
			my github account (symmy596).}

	{
		\begin{cvitems}
			\item {Throughout the duration of my PhD I have taught undergraduate chemists how to program, specifically focusing on high level programming
			in \textbf{Python} and low level programming in \textbf{fortran}.}
			\item {I developed a new masters level course focusing on using \textbf{Python} programming to better understand and make predictions about
			the behaviour of materials.}
			\item{Part of an ongoing project to develop a new masters course focusing on teaching students how to use \textbf{Python} in data analysis.}
			\item {Contributed a series of practical workshops designed to introduce PhD students from throughout the university to Unix and programming}
