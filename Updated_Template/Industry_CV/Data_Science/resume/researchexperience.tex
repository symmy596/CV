        \begin{cvitems}
          \item{PhD project supervised by Prof Steve Parker studying the effect of defects on the properties of materials}
          \item{Used classical molecular dynamics simulations to study oxygen transport in metal oxide grain boundaries. This has recently been expanded to study lithium transport in solid electrolyte materials.}
          \item{Used density functional theory to study the effect of dopants on the adsorption of atmospheric molecules on the surfaces of metal oxide materials. This included the development of new open source software dedicated to the analysis of DFT data.}
          \item{Used classical Monte Carlo simulations to study the distribution of defects in materials. This has been applied to metal oxide grain boundaries and solid electrolyte battery materials.}
          \item{Highly collaborative project, with academic collaborators at the Universities of Kent (Dean Sayle), Huddersfield (Marco Molinari), West of England (Arnaud Marmier) and Central Florida (Sudipta Seal), as well as industrial collaborators at AWE (Mark Storr and Robert Harker).}
          \item {Secured Â£31,000 of HPC time on the Archer supercomputer through membership of the MCC.}
